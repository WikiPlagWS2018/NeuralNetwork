## Neural Network
### General Idea
As Input, we have the Cosinus/Jaccard Similarity of all possible 13-Gramm Pairs between the Preselection and the text to check.
Our target is to identify which Pair is plagiarism. Therefore we use a Neural Network with two Input neurons (Cosinus/Jaccard Similarity) and two Output neurons (Plagiarism/No plagiarism). To train the Network, we created examples of 13-Gramm Pairs with Cosinus/Jaccard Similarity and labeled which pairs were plagiarism and which were not.
