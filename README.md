## Neural Network
### General Idea
As Input, we have the Cosinus/Jaccard Similarity of all possible 13-Gramm Pairs between the Preselection and the text to check.
Our target is to identify which Pair is plagiarism. Therefore we use a Neural Network with two Input neurons (Cosinus/Jaccard Similarity) and two Output neurons (Plagiarism/No plagiarism). To train the Network, we created examples of 13-Gramm Pairs with Cosinus/Jaccard Similarity and labeled which pairs were plagiarism and which were not.
  
### Data
Data.txt include 120 plagiarism Pairs and 308 Pairs which were not.  
DTrain: 1/3  
DVal: 1/3  
DTest: 1/3  
  
### Network architecture
Four fully Connected Layers with two neurons each  
  
activation function hidden: sigmoid  
activation function out: softmax  
optimizing: backpropagation with Logistic loss function and L-BFGS as optimization routine.  
  
epoch Number = 500
  
### Evaluation
Accuracy: 0.9097
(tp + tn) / (tp + fp + tn +fn)
  
Precision: 0.9128
tp / (tp + fp)
  
Recall: 0.9097
tp / (tp +fn)
  
tp = True Positive  
tn = True Negative  
fp = False Positive  
fn = False Negative  
  
  
### Information about Implementation
  
The Scala Object NN in the file NN.scla loads the Data, create a model, train the model and calculates Accuracy, Precision, Recall Score for DVal or DTest.
